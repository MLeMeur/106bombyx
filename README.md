#106bombyx

Project done in duo with Lucas Chaillou

Goal of the project:

    In the 70’s, chaos theory opened the way for a better understanding of the evolution of some animal
    species. Butterflys for instance. Let’s look at. . . bombyx.
    If a generation is crowded, chances are that the next generation will be crowded too, regarding the natural rules of
    reproduction. But resources may lack for this new generation, so it may not be able to develop.
    Therefore, the number of bombyx depends on those two contradictory factors, and its evolution is far from
    trivial.
